here is the code I use for training. In the folder examples, trans.py is used for gaining the continuous model from the learning process of static solution which is from the static.h5 file. Several cm files are different continuous models gaining from the learing of static solution which could be used in the training of the dynamical process.

The julia version for compiling the files is Julia 1.9.0
